The tax will be set at PLN 0.5 (EUR 0.11) in the case of a sugar content equal to or less than 5g in 100mL of the drink, with an additional fee of PLN 0.05 (EUR 0.01) per each gram of sugar above 5g/100mL.

Pursuant to the provisions of the Act, an additional fee applies to the introduction of beverages with the addition of:

• sugars that are monosaccharides or disaccharides and foodstuffs containing these substances and sweeteners referred to in the Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council (EC)

• caffeine or taurine.

The purpose of the introduced regulations was to use the fiscal policy as a tool to promote healthy consumer choices - to improve eating habits by limiting the consumption of sweet drinks. It is expected that the fee, as a tool used in counteracting civilization diseases, will change the consumption structure in the beverage category, which will result in savings for the health care system in the longer term (improvement in health indicators, reduction of overweight and obesity rates and diet-related diseases). The vast majority (96.5%) of the funds obtained from the so-called The sugar levy will go to the National Health Fund (NFZ), while the remaining part (3.5%) will be transferred to the state budget.

The expected revenues to the NHF budget in the first year of the fee being in force are about PLN 3 billion, which will be allocated to the implementation of educational and preventive activities as well as health care services related to maintaining and improving the health of beneficiaries with diseases developed due to improper health choices and behaviors , especially those who are overweight and obese.
